# XiLend: Technical Documentation & Grant Proposal

**Project Name:** XiLend
**Category:** Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Lending & Borrowing Protocol
**Date:** September 12, 2025

---

## 1. Abstract

XiLend is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol built on EVM-compatible blockchains. The protocol enables users to participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an over-collateralized fashion. The architecture is heavily inspired by the battle-tested Aave protocol, employing interest-bearing `ATokens` to represent deposited assets. XiLend is engineered with a modern, security-first toolchain, utilizing Foundry for smart contract development and testing, and a reactive Next.js frontend to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience. Our mission is to provide transparent, efficient, and secure money markets for the decentralized economy.

## 2. Project Overview & Vision

Decentralized lending has become a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem. XiLend aims to build upon the success of existing protocols by offering a highly optimized, secure, and user-friendly platform.

Our core innovation lies in our commitment to a modern, transparent, and robust technical stack that improves gas efficiency, enhances security, and provides a superior user experience.

### 2.1. Core User Interactions

*   **Depositing (Lending):** Users can deposit their crypto assets into XiLend's liquidity pools. In return, they receive an equivalent amount of interest-bearing `ATokens` (e.g., depositing USDC mints aUSDC). These `ATokens` accrue interest in real-time directly in the user's wallet.
*   **Borrowing:** Users can borrow assets from the pools by using their deposited `ATokens` as collateral. The amount a user can borrow is determined by the value of their collateral and the specific asset's "collateral factor."
*   **Repaying:** Borrowers can repay their loans at any time to unlock their underlying collateral.
*   **Withdrawing:** Depositors can withdraw their assets by redeeming their `ATokens`, which are burned in the process.

### 2.2. Key Differentiators

*   **Modern Tooling:** Use of Foundry for faster, more robust testing and deployment.
*   **Gas Optimization:** Focus on writing highly-optimized Solidity code.
*   **Superior UX:** A clean, responsive, and intuitive frontend built with Next.js and `shadcn/ui`.
*   **Security Focus:** Adherence to best practices, use of OpenZeppelin standards, and a comprehensive testing suite.

## 3. Technical Architecture

XiLend's architecture is split into two main components: the on-chain smart contracts that form the protocol's backend and the off-chain frontend that serves as the user interface.

### 3.1. Smart Contracts (Backend)

The smart contract suite is developed using the **Foundry** framework, which enables efficient compilation, testing (including fuzzing and fork testing), and deployment. Our contracts are built upon the industry-standard **OpenZeppelin Contracts** library to ensure security and adherence to best practices.

#### Core Contracts:

*   **`LendingPool.sol`**: The main entry point for the protocol. This contract orchestrates the core logic, handling user actions such as `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `borrow()`, and `repay()`. It serves as the facade that connects all other protocol components.
    *   `[TODO: Add specific details about unique functions or modifiers in LendingPool.sol]`

*   **`CollateralManager.sol`**: Manages all logic related to user collateral. It tracks each user's collateral status and is responsible for processing liquidations if a user's health factor drops below the required threshold.
    *   `[TODO: Detail the liquidation mechanism, including the liquidation bonus and the role of liquidators.]`

*   **`InterestRateModel.sol`**: A modular contract that defines the interest rate curves for each asset. Rates are calculated algorithmically based on the utilization rate of the asset pool (Total Borrows / Total Supply). This dynamic model ensures that interest rates respond to market supply and demand.
    *   `[TODO: Specify the mathematical model used, e.g., a linear or piecewise linear model, and its key parameters (base rate, slope, etc.).]`

*   **`AToken.sol`**: An ERC20-compliant token that represents a user's deposit in the protocol. These are interest-bearing tokens that increase in balance over time to reflect the interest earned by the underlying asset. The implementation follows the Aave aToken standard.
    *   `[TODO: Explain the interest accrual mechanism, e.g., how the scaled balance is updated.]`

*   **`PriceOracle.sol`**: Provides the protocol with reliable, real-time price feeds for all supported assets. This is critical for calculating collateral value, borrowing power, and liquidation thresholds. Our current implementation is designed to be modular, allowing for different oracle sources (e.g., Chainlink, Uniswap TWAP).
    *   `[TODO: Specify the primary oracle source (e.g., Chainlink Price Feeds) and any fallback mechanisms.]`

#### Security Considerations:

*   **Reentrancy Guards:** All critical state-changing functions utilize OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`.
*   **Ownership and Access Control:** Critical functions are protected with `Ownable` to ensure only authorized addresses can perform administrative tasks.
*   **Comprehensive Test Suite:** The protocol is tested with a suite of unit, integration, and fork tests within the Foundry framework.

### 3.2. Frontend (Client-Side)

The frontend is a modern, server-rendered React application built with **Next.js**. This provides excellent performance, SEO, and a rich user experience.

#### Key Technologies:

*   **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript.
*   **UI Library:** A combination of **shadcn/ui** and custom components for a polished, consistent, and accessible design system.
*   **Blockchain Interaction:** We use **Wagmi** and **Viem** for wallet connection, contract interaction, and event handling. This provides a robust and type-safe connection to the blockchain.
*   **State Management:** A combination of React's native state/context and custom hooks (`useLendingPool`, `usePriceOracle`) to manage application and blockchain state.

#### Component Architecture:

The UI is broken down into logical, reusable components:

*   **Forms:** `DepositForm`, `BorrowForm`, `RepayForm`, `WithdrawForm` encapsulate the core user actions.
*   **Data Display:** `TransactionHistory` and other components provide users with clear insight into their activity and the protocol's state.
*   **Hooks:** Custom hooks like `useLendingPool.ts` and `usePriceOracle.ts` abstract away the complexities of blockchain interactions, keeping the UI components clean and focused on presentation.

## 4. Deployment and Go-to-Market

### 4.1. Target Chains

The protocol is designed to be EVM-compatible and is initially targeted for deployment on:
*   **Sepolia Testnet** (for final public testing)
*   **Ethereum Mainnet**
*   **Layer 2s:** Arbitrum, Optimism (to offer users lower transaction fees)

### 4.2. Deployment Process

Deployments are managed via Foundry's scripting capabilities (`script/Deploy.s.sol`), ensuring a repeatable, verifiable, and secure deployment process.

---

## 5. Testing

We believe rigorous testing is non-negotiable in DeFi. Our testing strategy includes:

*   **Unit Tests:** Each contract's functions are tested in isolation.
*   **Integration Tests:** Testing the interactions between different contracts within the protocol.
*   **Fork Testing:** Running tests on a forked mainnet state to simulate real-world conditions with actual assets and protocol interactions.
*   **Fuzz Testing:** Using Foundry's built-in fuzzer to test functions with a wide range of random inputs to uncover edge cases.

## 6. Future Roadmap

    *   Complete a full security audit from a reputable firm.
    *   Launch on Ethereum Mainnet.

*   **Q1 2026: Asset Expansion & L2 Deployment**
